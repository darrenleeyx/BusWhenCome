# 🚌 BusWhenCome

**BusWhenCome** is a minimalist web app to check when the next bus will arrive at a bus stop in Singapore.  

This project is in early development and not yet production-ready.

## 🚀 Motivation

I wanted a no-nonsense, fast-loading app that shows me exactly what I need: when the next bus is coming.  
No ads, no unnecessary navigation, no bloat — just clean and useful info.

## 🔧 Features (Planned)

- 🔍 Search by bus stop code
- 🕒 Real-time bus arrival info
- 📱 Minimal UI

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

BusWhenCome is built with:
- **Blazor Web App** because I love C#
- **API**: [ArriveLah Proxy](https://github.com/cheeaun/arrivelah) to LTA DataMall
- **Data Source**: SMRT's public list of bus stops

## 🗺️ Live Demo

Coming soon!
